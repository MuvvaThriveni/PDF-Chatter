<h1 align='center'>Chat with your PDF ðŸ¦œðŸ“„</h1>

Chat with your PDF is an innovative application powered by advanced technologies to enhance your interaction and understanding of PDF documents.

### Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG)
- The implementation of Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) within the Chat with your PDF application represents a sophisticated approach to enhancing document understanding. RAG is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval and generative language models to provide a comprehensive understanding of the document context, ensuring precise and context-aware responses.

### Chromadb Vector Database Integration
- Seamless Integration: Successfully integrated the high-performance Chromadb vector database into Chat with your PDF.
- Optimized Search Capability: Leveraged Chromadb to optimize vector similarity search, ensuring swift and accurate retrieval of pertinent information from PDF documents.
- Enhanced Retrieval Efficiency: The integration of Chromadb significantly improves the application's ability to handle user queries effectively, delivering precise and contextually 
  relevant responses.
  
### Embeddings Implementation
- Model: The embeddings are created using the SentenceTransformer model with the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" configuration.
- Process: The PDF documents are ingested, and the text content is split using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. Sentence embeddings are then generated using the SentenceTransformer model, 
  capturing semantic information from the documents.
- Integration: The embeddings play a crucial role in information retrieval, enhancing language understanding within the application.

### MBZUAI/LaMini-T5-738M Model Integration
- Integrated the LaMini-T5 738M model,a state-of-the-art transformer-based model designed for sequence-to-sequence language tasks.
- This integration empowers the application with advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling dynamic conversations and coherent, contextually relevant answers.

### Streamlit-Powered User Interface
- Led the design and development of a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
- Created an intuitive platform for seamless navigation through PDFs, enhancing user accessibility for both professionals and students.
### Technology Stack
- Utilized Python, Huggingface MBZUAI/LaMini-T5-738M Model , Chromadb vector database, Streamlit, and Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) to create a seamlessly integrated and cutting-edge application.
